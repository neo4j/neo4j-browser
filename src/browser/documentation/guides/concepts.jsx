      <p>
        A graph database can store any kind of data using a few simple concepts:
      </p>
      <ol className="big">
        <li>Nodes - graph data records</li>
        <li>Relationships - connect nodes</li>
        <li>Properties - named data values</li>

        A&nbsp;
        <em>Graph</em> Database
      </h3>
      <p className="lead">
        Neo4j stores data in a Graph, with records called Nodes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-sm-5">
      <p>
        The simplest graph has just a single node with some named values called
        Properties. Let's draw a social graph of our friends on the Neo4j team:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start by drawing a circle for the node</li>
        <li>Add the name Emil</li>
        <li>Note that he is from Sweden</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>Nodes are the name for data records in a graph</li>
        <li>Data is stored as Properties</li>
        <li>Properties are simple name/value pairs</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className="col-sm-4">

      <h3>Labels</h3>
      <p className="lead">Associate a set of nodes.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-sm-5">
      <p>
        Nodes can be grouped together by applying a Label to each member. In our
        social graph, we'll label each node that represents a Person.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Apply the label "Person" to the node we created for Emil</li>
        <li>Color "Person" nodes red</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>A node can have zero or more labels</li>
        <li>Labels do not have any properties</li>

      <h3>More Nodes</h3>
      <p className="lead">
        Schema-free, nodes can have a mix of common and unique properties.
      </p>

    <div className="col-sm-5">
      <p>
        Like any database, storing data in Neo4j can be as simple as adding more
        records. We'll add a few more nodes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Emil has a klout score of 99</li>
        <li>Johan, from Sweden, who is learning to surf</li>
        <li>Ian, from England, who is an author</li>
        <li>Rik, from Belgium, has a cat named Orval</li>
        <li>Allison, from California, who surfs</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>Similar nodes can have different properties</li>
        <li>Properties can be strings, numbers, or booleans</li>
        <li>Neo4j can store billions of nodes</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div className="col-sm-4">

      <h3>Consider Relationships</h3>
      <p className="lead">Connect nodes in the graph</p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-sm-5">
      <p className="summary">
        The real power of Neo4j is in connected data. To associate any two
        nodes, add a Relationship which describes how the records are related.
      </p>
      <p>In our social graph, we simply say who KNOWS whom:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Emil KNOWS Johan and Ian</li>
        <li>Johan KNOWS Ian and Rik</li>
        <li>Rik and Ian KNOWS Allison</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>Relationships always have direction</li>
        <li>Relationships always have a type</li>
        <li>Relationships form patterns of data</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="summary">
        In a property graph, relationships are data records that can also
        contain properties. Looking more closely at Emil's relationships, note
        that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Emil has known Johan since 2001</li>
        <li>Emil rates Ian 5 (out of 5)</li>
        <li>Everyone else can have similar relationship properties</li>
