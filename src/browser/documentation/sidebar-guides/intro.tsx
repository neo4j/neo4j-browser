    <h3>Navigating Neo4j Browser</h3>
    <p>
      Neo4j Browser is a command-driven client as a web-based shell environment.
      It is perfect for running ad-hoc graph queries, with just enough ability
      to prototype a Neo4j-based application.

    <ul className="big">

      <li>Used for writing and running Cypher graph queries.</li>
      <li>Exportable tabular results of any query result.</li>

    <h3>Browser Editor (a.k.a. Editor)</h3>
    <p className="lead">
      <em>Edit and execute Cypher statements and Browser commands</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Editor is the primary interface for entering and running Cypher
      statements and Browser commands. Browser commands begin with{' '}
      <code>:</code>, for example, <code>:help</code>.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Execute current command</td>
          <td className="padding5">
            <div className="key code">
              {isMac ? '<Cmd-Return>' : '<Ctrl-Return>'}
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      You can view the list of keybinding anytime by running{' '}
      <code>:help keys</code> or by pressing <b>F1 </b>in the Editor to see all
      Editor-specific keybindings.

    <h3>Result frame</h3>
    <p className="lead">
      <em>Most recently executed command or Cypher query</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      A result frame is created for each execution and added to the top of the
      stream to create a scrollable collection in reverse chronological order.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A pinned frame always stays in the same position. </li>
      <li>
        You can clear the stream of result frames by running the{' '}
        <code>:clear</code> command.
      </li>
      <li>
        The maximum number of result frames displayed in the stream is 30. You
        can change this number in the Browser Settings drawer.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        You can bring up the history of the executed commands and queries by
        running the <code className="nobreak">:history</code> command.
      </li>

    <p>
      You can also iterate in the same frame instead of generating a scrollable
      stream of frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each reusable frame maintains its own local history of commands and
      updates the main one in the Editor, should you need to instantiate a new
      result frame from there.

    <h3>Sidebar: Database</h3>
    <p className="lead">
      <em>Database information</em>
    </p>
    When Neo4j is installed, it is initiated with two databases â€“ a{' '}
    <code>system</code> database and a default <code>neo4j</code> database.
    Launching Neo4j Browser automatically points you to the{' '}
    <code className="nobreak">neo4j</code> database, shown by the{' '}
    <code>neo4j$</code>
    prompt in the Editor.

      <em>Quick way to save your queries</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Favorite queries or commands can be saved in the local storage and
      displayed in the sidebar.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      Favorites are global and independent of project or database, which means
      that you can access your Favorites from Neo4j Browser with different
      databases, hosting platforms, and data sets.

    <h3>Sidebar: Project files</h3>
    <p className="lead">
      <em>Save cypher files to share with your colleagues</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Project files allows you to save queries, guides, and other scripts, as
      Cypher files. Unlike favorites, which are saved in your local browser
      storage, project files are project-specific and are actual files stored in
      the project directory on your hard drive. All saved files are listed under
      the project they refer to.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The Project Files drawer is Neo4j Desktop specific.</p>
