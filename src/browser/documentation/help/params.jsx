    <p>
      The
      <code>:param name => 'Stella'</code> command will define a parameter named
      "name" and it will be sent along with your queries.
      <br /> Using parameters, rather than hard coding values, will allow for
      reuse of the query plan cache
    </p>
    <p>
      The right hand side of
      <code>=></code> is sent to the server and evaluated as Cypher with an
      implicit
      <code>RETURN</code> in front. This gives better type safety since some
      types (especially numbers) in JavaScript are hard to match with Neo4j:s
      type system.
      <br />
      To set a param as an integer, do
      <code>:param x => 1</code> and to set it as a float, do
      <code>:param x => 1.0</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need more fine-grained control or advanced Cypher queries, you can
      use the explicit syntax: <code>{`x => { ... RETURN 1 as foo }`}</code>
      <br />
      Explicit returns yield a list of records, matching that of your Cypher
      query: <code>{`x => { RETURN 1 as foo }`}</code> yields{' '}
      <code>{`$x = [{foo: 1}]`}</code>
      <br />
      You can pick out individual values from your result using destructuring:{' '}
      <code>{`[{foo}] => { RETURN 1 as foo }`}</code> yields{' '}
      <code>{`$foo = 1`}</code>
      <br />
      You can also rename destructured params:{' '}
      <code>{`[{foo: bar}] => { RETURN 1 as foo }`}</code> yields{' '}
      <code>{`$bar = 1`}</code>
    </p>

      <code>{`MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.name = $name`}</code>
