    <p>
      The <code>MATCH</code> clause describes a pattern of graph data. Neo4j
      will collect all paths within the graph which match this pattern. This is
      often used with <code>WHERE</code> to filter the collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>MATCH</code> describes the structure, and <code>WHERE</code>{' '}
      specifies the content of a query.
