    <p>
      The
      <code>:param name {'=>'} 'Stella'</code> command will define a parameter
      named "name" and it will be sent along with your queries.
      <br /> Using parameters, rather than hard coding values, will allow for
      reuse of the query plan cache
    </p>
    <p>
      The right hand side of
      <code>{'=>'}</code> is sent to the server and evaluated as Cypher with an
      implicit
      <code>RETURN</code> in front. This gives better type safety since some
      types (especially numbers) in JavaScript are hard to match with Neo4j:s
      type system.
      <br /> To set a param as an integer, do
      <code>:param x {'=>'} 1</code> and to set it as a float, do
      <code>:param x {'=>'} 1.0</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cypher query example with a param:
      <code>MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.name = $name</code>
