      The <code>DELETE</code> clause is used to delete nodes and relationships
      identified within a <code>MATCH</code> clause, possibly qualified by a{' '}
      <code>WHERE</code>. Remember that you can not delete a node without also
      deleting relationships that start or end on said node.
