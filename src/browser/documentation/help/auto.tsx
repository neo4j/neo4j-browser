    <p>
      The <code>:auto</code> command will send the Cypher query following it, in
      an auto committing transaction. In general this is not recommended because
      of the lack of support for auto retrying on leader switch errors in
      clusters.
      <br />
      Some query types do however need to be sent in auto-committing
      transactions, <code>USING PERIODIC COMMIT</code> is the most notable one.
