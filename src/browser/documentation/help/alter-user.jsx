          Users can change their own password using ALTER CURRENT USER SET
          PASSWORD. The old password is required in addition to the new one, and
          either or both can be a string value or a string parameter. When a
          user executes this command it will change their password as well as
          set the CHANGE NOT REQUIRED flag.
