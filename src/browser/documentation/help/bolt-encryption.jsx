    <p>
      Because of how web browsers handle (self signed) certificates the web
      browser needs to go to a HTTPS URL and accept / permanently trust the
      certificate before a secure Bolt connection to the server can be created.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default Neo4j offers a HTTPS URL on{' '}
      <a href="https://localhost:7473">https://localhost:7473</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will need to manually view (usually by clicking in a broken padlock in
      the address bar) and trust the certificate to be able to create a secure
      connection.
