        <p class="subtitle">What drivers are used when</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>There are two kinds of Bolt drivers specified by URI scheme: the 'bolt://' scheme is used to create a&nbsp;<b>direct&nbsp;</b>driver and the 'bolt+routing://' scheme is used to create a&nbsp;<b>routing&nbsp;</b>driver. In Neo4j Browser, the bolt+routing setting is used to control which driver should be used. However it is not always appropriate for Neo4j Browser to use a&nbsp;<b>routing&nbsp;</b>driver even when bolt+routing is on.</p>
        <p>Neo4j Browser will always:
          <ul class="topic-bullets">
            <li>use a&nbsp;<b>direct&nbsp;</b>driver for user administration frames</li>
            <li>use a&nbsp;<b>direct&nbsp;</b>driver to populate sysinfo and the member specific items in the information panel e.g. version, cluster role etc</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If bolt+routing is on and the provided URI points to a Core Causal Cluster member Neo4j Browser will:</p>
        <p>
          <ul class="topic-bullets">
            <li>use a&nbsp;<b>routing&nbsp;</b>driver for all cypher queries submitted via the editor (including calls to user administration procedures)</li>
            <li>use a&nbsp;<b>routing&nbsp;</b>driver to populate the metadata (labels, relationship types, properties) in the information panel</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>If bolt+routing is off or the provided URI does not point to a Causal Cluster member or the provided URI points to a Read-Replica Causal Cluster member, Neo4j Browser will:</p>
        <p>
          <ul class="topic-bullets">
            <li>use a&nbsp;<b>direct&nbsp;</b>driver for all cypher queries submitted via the editor</li>
            <li>use a&nbsp;<b>direct&nbsp;</b>driver to populate the metadata (labels, relationship types, properties) in the information panel</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Please note that in order for bolt+routing to work correctly the current user must exist on all members in the cluster with the same authentication credentials.</p>
