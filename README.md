Neo4j Browser is the general purpose graphical user interface for Neo4j. Query, visualize, administer and monitor the database with modern and easy-to-use tools.

## Demo

You can try out the latest (unreleased) version of Neo4j Browser at [http://browser-canary.graphapp.io/](http://browser-canary.graphapp.io/).

Keep in mind that you will need to connect to an instance of Neo4j (the database) for most operations in Neo4j Browser. A simple way to get started is through [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/). Once you've started a database it's by default available for Neo4j Browser to connect to on **localhost:7687**.

## Project structure

Browser has a subproject of re-usable components bundled together and exposed as `neo4j-arc`. Rather than set up mono-repo tooling the we've set up eslint to isolate `neo4j-arc` and given it a seperate build step. Code in browser can only to import code from `neo4j-arc` through `neo4j-arc` aliases (as if it was a seperate project) and `neo4j-arc` is not allowed to import any code from outside it's own folder.

## Development

Running Neo4j Browser locally requires Node.js (^12.4.0) and for dependencies we use yarn (`npm install -g yarn`).
To install dependencies and then start the development server at `http://localhost:8080`:

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

Or to run in production mode:

```shell
yarn start-prod
```

### Testing overview

Neo4j Browser has both unit and end to end tests running automatically on every pull request. To run the tests locally:

`yarn test-unit` runs a linter and then our unit tests.

`yarn test-e2e` runs our Cypress end to end tests in the easiest, slowest way. Running them with this command requires docker installed and that nothing else runs on ports 7687 and 8080.

#### Cypress e2e test suite in depth

`yarn e2e-open` to open the Cypress test runner (requires a **fresh** installation of Neo4j to run against, expects neo4j 3.5 by default). See details below on how to configure database version.

`yarn e2e-local-open` to run against an existing server (with a password already set). We use `newpassword` as the default password here, make sure to pass your password:
`yarn e2e-local-open --env browser-password=<your-password-here>`

To avoid opening the Cypress test runner and just run the tests in the terminal, remove the "-open" suffix from the previous two commands (so `yarn e2e` and `yarn e2e-local` respectively).

So to run tests on your existing 4.2 database with the password "hunter2" without opening the Cypress visual test runner:
`yarn e2e-local --env browser-password=hunter2,server=4.2`

All the available options for `--env` are:

```
server=3.5|4.0|4.1|4.2|4.3 (default 4.3)
edition=enterprise|community|aura (default enterprise)
browser-password=<your-pw> (default 'newpassword')
include-import-tests=true|false (default false)
bolt-url=<bolt url excluding the protocol> (default localhost:7687)
```

There are some additional options that can only be set as system environmental variables (meaning they cannot be set using the `--env` flag as the ones above).
These needs to be set before the test command is run.

```
CYPRESS_E2E_TEST_ENV=local|null (if the initial set of pw should run or not) (default undefined)
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=<url to reach the browser to test> (default http://localhost:8080)
```

Example: `CYPRESS_E2E_TEST_ENV="local" CYPRESS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:30000 cypress open --env server=4.2`
