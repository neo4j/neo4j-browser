        h3 bolt+routing in Neo4j Browser
        p.lead What drivers are used when
      .details.col-sm-9
        p
          | There are two kinds of Bolt drivers specified by URI scheme: the 'bolt://' scheme is used to create a&nbsp;
          b direct&nbsp;
          | driver and the 'bolt+routing://' scheme is used to create a&nbsp;
          b routing&nbsp;
          | driver. In Neo4j Browser, the bolt+routing setting is used to control which driver should be used. However it is not always appropriate for Neo4j Browser to use a&nbsp;
          b routing&nbsp;
          | driver even when bolt+routing is on.
        p
          | Neo4j Browser will always:
          ul.topic-bullets
            li
              | use a&nbsp;
              b direct&nbsp;
              | driver for user administration frames
            li
              | use a&nbsp;
              b direct&nbsp;
              | driver to populate sysinfo and the member specific items in the information panel e.g. version, cluster role etc
        p
          | If bolt+routing is on and the provided URI points to a Core Causal Cluster member Neo4j Browser will:
        p
          ul.topic-bullets
            li
              | use a&nbsp;
              b routing&nbsp;
              | driver for all cypher queries submitted via the editor (including calls to user admininstration procedures)
            li
              | use a&nbsp;
              b routing&nbsp;
              | driver to populate the metadata (labels, relationship types, properties) in the information panel
        p
          | If bolt+routing is off or the provided URI does not point to a Causal Cluster member or the provided URI points to a Read-Replica Causal Cluster member, Neo4j Browser will:
        p
          ul.topic-bullets
            li
              | use a&nbsp;
              b direct&nbsp;
              | driver for all cypher queries submitted via the editor
            li
              | use a&nbsp;
              b direct&nbsp;
              | driver to populate the metadata (labels, relationship types, properties) in the information panel


        p Please note that in order for bolt+routing to work correctly the current user must exist on all members in the cluster with the same authentication credentials.
