# Refresh Token with on auth0-angular

This shows how to use refreshToken with Auth0-angular.

> **Warning**: Please bare in mind that having a `refreshToken` means that you'll always be able to get a usable `idToken` unless the `refreshToken` is revoked.

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
1. run npm install -g serve
1. run serve in the directory of this project.
