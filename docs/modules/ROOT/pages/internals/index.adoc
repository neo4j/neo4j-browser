= Neo4J Browser Internals

The Neo4J Browser is logically composed of 2 parts:

1. A slightly coupled graphing module
2. A user-interface that combines the graph rendering (supported by the graphing module), database, and user
   interaction together

The graphing is based on D3 but pretty much developed from scratch by building everything on top of D3 and implementing
its own layout, coloring, and link drawing. For example, the calculation of arrow (e.g. node links) between nodes
uses some very complicated math along with very prelimiary MDN standard basic shap specification.

[WARNING]
====
We will not have any TypeDoc documentation, because the TypeScript version used in Neo4J Browser is not supprted by it
