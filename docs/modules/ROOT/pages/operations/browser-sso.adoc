:description: Single Sign-On (SSO) for Neo4j Browser.


[[browser-sso]]
= Browser Single Sign-On

Neo4j Browser provides basic support for some Single Sign-On (SSO) providers under specific Enterprise environment configurations.
Contact Neo4j Professional Services for additional assistance (see link:https://neo4j.com/professional-services/[_https://neo4j.com/professional-services/_^] for more information about Professional Services).
Your organization needs an existing compatible SSO provider (local or external) already configured.

[NOTE]
====
Single Sign-On is _only_ available with the Enterprise Edition of Neo4j and requires engagement from Neo4j Professional Services to configure.
General availability of SSO for Enterprise customers that does not require Professional Services' involvement is planned in a future release.
====

Supported providers at this time include OpenID Connect (OIDC) OAuth 2.0 providers Okta, KeyCloak, and Microsoft Azure AD.
SSO has been tested on Neo4j 4.2.x and 4.3.x deployments.
Browser supports two authorization flows:

* Authorization Code flow with PKCE.
* Implicit flow.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is strongly advised to use PKCE to ensure security.
Further information about OpenID Connect and OAuth can be found at link:https://openid.net/connect/[https://openid.net/connect/^].
====

In addition to having an SSO provider already configured at your organization, configuring SSO for Browser and Neo4j requires a separate OAuth plugin development engagement with Neo4j Professional Services.
With these prerequisites in place, two additional steps are required:

. The link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/neo4j-conf/#neo4j-conf[`neo4j.conf`^] file should be updated with the following information (be sure to avoid duplicate entries in the `neo4j.conf` file):
+

dbms.security.auth_enabled=true
dbms.security.authentication_providers=native,plugin-org.neo4j.auth.openid.OpenIdPlugin
dbms.security.authorization_providers=native,plugin-org.neo4j.auth.openid.OpenIdPlugin

Optionally, you may set extra logging for the OAuth2 plugin with these settings in the `neo4j.conf` file.
The logs are found in the `neo4j.log` file.
The `:debug` command contains logging from the SSO implementation and can be useful when debugging.

. Browser needs to be aware of the identity providers available for use.
This is done by specifying a URL parameter discoveryURL that specifies a URL to a json file containing the SSO providers.
Example for Browser:
+
[source, url, role="noheader"]
----
http://<browser-server-host>:<http-port>?discoveryURL=http://webhost.com/public/discovery.json
----
+
The `discovery.json` file must contain entries tailored to your organizationâ€™s specific SSO solution.
Below is a reference discovery file for the ID provider (IDP) _Keycloak_ containing one SSO provider and set up to be running on port 18080.
It contains all the possible parameters you can provide.
You most likely do not need all the parameters.
If you are unsure, please consult Neo4j Professional Services to avoid misconfiguration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
`redirect_uri` MUST match exactly the redirect_uri specified in the IdP.

The following URL parameters support SSO in Browser:

.URL parameters
[cols="2,3,3,3", options=header]
|===
| URL (search parameter)   	| Syntax | Example | Description
|`sso_redirect` | `sso_redirect=<idp_id>` 	| `sso_redirect=keycloak-oidc`	| Use to auto-redirect to SSO login page.
|`auth_flow_step` | `auth_flow_step=<arg>`	| `auth_flow_step=redirect_uri`	| If the user arrives back to the client application with the URL param `auth_flow_step=redirect_uri`, this indicates that it is time to proceed in the auth process.
|`idp_id` | `idp_id=<idp_id>`	| `idp_id=keycloak-oidc` 	| The user arrives with a URL param named idp_id, mapped to the information in the discovery data to figure out how to proceed.
