:description: Overview for the result frames.


[[result-frames]]
= Result frames

There are a variety of ways to view data in Neo4j Browser.
All queries that you run in the Cypher editor populate a reusable result frame.
Query results are rendered as:

* Visual graph -- graph result frame.
* Table -- table result frame.
* Plain text table -- plain text result frame.
* Meta data -- code result frame.

You can switch between those with the icons on the left side of the result frame.

[TIP]
====
If you cannot see the result, you might be in Graph mode but had your query return tabular/scalar data.
To see the results, switch the mode to the *Table* view.

[[graph-result-frame]]
== Graph result frame

The graph visualization functionality is designed to display a node-graph representation of the underlying data stored in the database in response to a given Cypher query.
It shows circles for nodes and lines for relationships, and is especially useful for determining areas of interest or quickly assessing the current state and organization of the data.

.Handy tips
[TIP]
====
* Enable zoom in and out of your graph by entering into fullscreen mode.
* Expand and remove nodes from the visualization by clicking a node.
It gets a halo, where you can dismiss a node, expand/collapse child relationships, or unlock the node to re-layout the graph.
Double-clicking a node expands its child relationships.
* If you cannot see the whole graph or the results display too close together, you can adjust by moving the visual view and dragging nodes to rearrange them.
* To move the view to see more parts of the graph, click an empty spot within the graph pane and drag it.
* To rearrange nodes, click and drag them around.
* The nodes already have sensible captions assigned by the browser, which auto-selects a property from the property list to use as a caption.
You can see all the properties of that element if you click any node or relationship.
Properties appear below the visualization.
* Larger property sets might be collapsed into a subset, and there is a little triangle on the right to unfold them.
For example, if you click one of the `Movie` nodes in the MovieGraph (`:guide movie graph`), you can see its properties below the graph visualization.
The same applies to `Actor` nodes and the `ACTED_IN` relationships.

[[table-result-frame]]
== Table result frame

The *Table* result view displays the result in a table format.
It also reports the query time, including the actual query execution time, latency, and deserialization costs.

Even if you feel that the relationship is not hard to find in the tabular format, imagine if you have a graph containing the entire filmography careers of these persons and hundreds of other actors, directors, and film crew members.
The connections could easily be lost in a non-visual presentation.


[[plain-text-result-frame]]
== Plain text result frame 

The *Text* result view displays the result as a plain text table.
It also reports the query time, including the actual query execution time, latency, and deserialization costs.

[[code-result-frame]]
== Code result frame

The *Code* result view displays the submitted request, the Neo4j Server version and address, and the response.
It also reports the query time, including the actual query execution time, latency, and deserialization costs.
