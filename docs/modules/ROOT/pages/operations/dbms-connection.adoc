:description: Establish a connection to Neo4j database.

[[dbms-connection]]
= Connect to a Neo4j DBMS

Neo4j Browser is the easiest way to access a Neo4j database.
To establish a connection, you enter the DBMS URL, the name of the database you want to connect, and the user credentials.
You can also use the `:server` command to manage the connection to Neo4j.
For more information, see <<manage-connection>>.

[[uri-scheme]]
== Connection URI schemes

Neo4j Browser requires a connection to a Neo4j DBMS via the link:https://7687.org/[Bolt Protocol^] using the link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/javascript-manual/current/[Neo4j JavaScript Driver^] to execute Cypher queries.

Neo4j Browser supports the following connection URI schemes:

* `neo4j://`(unencrypted) and `neo4j+s://` (encrypted with TLS) -- work on either a single instance or a cluster.
Routing is handled by the driver.
If used on a cluster, it routes to a cluster member, not necessarily the system at the IP that you specified.
Queries executed over that protocol route according to the transaction functions --_write_ transactions go to the leader and _read_ transactions route between followers and read replicas.

* `bolt://`(unencrypted) and `bolt+s://` (encrypted with TLS) -- connect only to the server with the IP you specify.
It does not route anywhere else.
All queries over this protocol go only to this machine, whether they are _read_ or _write_ queries.
_Write_ queries error out if not being sent to the Cluster leader.

If used on a single server (not a cluster), then queries over them will behave identically.
A difference in the behavior in `neo4j://` and `bolt://` is seen only if addressing a cluster member.

[TIP]
====
For more information on the different connection scenarios, see <<connection-scenarios>>.
For more information on how to configure connectors (Bolt, HTTP, and HTTPS) for Neo4j and the default ports, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/{neo4j-version}/configuration/connectors/#connectors[Operations Manual -> Configure connectors^] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/ports/[Operations Manual -> Ports^].
====

[NOTE]
====
URI schemes ending `+ssc` are not supported by Neo4j Browser since the browserâ€™s OS handles certificate trust. 
If it is necessary to connect to a Neo4j instance using a self-signed certificate from Neo4j Browser, first visit a web page that uses the self-signed certificate in order to prompt the browser to request that certificate trust be granted. 
Once that trust has been granted, you can connect with URI schemes ending `+s`.
Alternatevely, you can trust self-signed certificate by installing them on your OS. 
For more information, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/security/ssl-framework/#ssl-bolt-config[Operations Manual -> SSL Framework, Configure SSL over Bolt].

[[manage-connection]]
== Manage connection commands

The `:server` command lets you manage the connection to Neo4j, such as connecting, disconnecting, and viewing metadata for the current connection.

Usage::	`:server <action>`

Actions::
* `:server status` -- Connection status.
This is your current connection information.
* `:server change-password` -- Opens the frame *Password change*, where you can change your current password.

Auth::
* `:server connect` -- Opens the frame *Connect to Neo4j*.
If connected to the server, the frame shows the current user and the connection URL.
Otherwise, enter the name of the database you want to connect, the DBMS URL, and the user credentials.
* `:server disconnect` -- Opens the frame *Disconnected*, which shows that the current user is disconnected from the server.
Then, it runs the `:server connect` automatically.

User::
`:help server user` - opens the frame *User admin*.

Neo4j Browser is available as a web application at link:https://browser.graphapp.io/[_https://browser.graphapp.io/_^].

.Neo4j Browser - Sandbox

In link:https://neo4j.com/sandbox/[Neo4j sandbox], you can launch a Neo4j Browser web application by clicking *Open with Browser*.
It automatically connects with a connection URL similar to:

`bolt+s://ba99a8c2d1c755f0c0cc2a95d0a627ea.neo4jsandbox.com:7687`

.Neo4j Browser - Neo4j Aura

In the https://console.neo4j.io[Neo4j Aura console], Neo4j Browser can be accessed as a web application within the user interface.
The Neo4j Browser web application connects to your Neo4j instance without having to enter any connection URL.

The connection URL is similar to:

`neo4j+s://358a0e8a.databases.neo4j.io`

Each database has a `dbid` that can be inferred from the Aura Console.

The URL `+https://<dbid>.databases.neo4j.io/browser/+` can also be used to access Neo4j Browser for that specific `dbid` on Neo4j Aura.
