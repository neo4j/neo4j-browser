= Node and relationship counts with role-based access control

Normally Neo4j Browser can look up node and relationship counts quickly, as they are cached in the database.
However, if role-based access control is configured (see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/access-control/[Operations Manual -> Fine-grained access control^] for more information), Neo4j counts the nodes and relationships the current user has access to on-demand, which is computationally expensive and thus potentially time-consuming. 
If Neo4j Browser detects that the counts are slow, it automatically stops polling counts and instead show a button for manual refresh.
