:description: Customize the graph query result.


[[browser-styling]]
= Browser styling

You can customize your graph query result either in place or by using Graph Stylesheet (GraSS).


[[graph-style]]
== Style your graph visualization in place

Neo4j Browser also provides functionality for styling with color and size, based on node labels and relationship types.

.Label and type overview
[caption="Label and type overview"]

If you select a node label in the _Overview_, there are several styling options available:

* Color -- set the color for nodes of the selected label.
* Size  -- set the size for nodes of the selected label.
* Caption -- set what should be displayed as the caption for nodes of the selected label.

.Set node style

If you select a relationship type in the _Overview_, there are several styling options available:

* Color -- set the color for relationships of the selected type.
* Line width  -- set the line width for relationships of the selected type.
* Caption -- set what should be displayed as the caption for relationships of the selected type.

.Set relationship style

If you select a node in the _graph result frame_, the _Node Properties_ shows labels and properties; selecting a node label works the same as in the _Overview_.

.Styling for selected node labels
=====
You can click the `Movie` label in the graph and change the color, size, and captions of all nodes labeled with `Movie`.

.Changes to nodes labeled `Movie`
[caption="Changes to nodes labeled `Movie`"]

=====

If you select a relationship in the _graph result frame_, the _Relationship Properties_ shows the type and properties; selecting the type works the same as in the _Overview_.

.Styling for selected relationship types
=====
You can click a relationship in the graph and change the color, line width, and captions of all relationships with the same type.
For example the `ACTED_IN` is selected.

.Changes to relationships with type `ACTED_IN`

[[grass]]
== Style your graph visualization using a GraSS file

Alternatively, follow the steps to customize your styles by importing a graph stylesheet (GraSS) file for Neo4j Browser to reference.

. Run the command `:style` and download your current graph style by using the *Export GraSS* option.

If a node has 2 styled labels, only the first (closest to top) style is applied.
If a node does not have a label that is in the GraSS, `node` is used as the default.
Same applies to relationships.
