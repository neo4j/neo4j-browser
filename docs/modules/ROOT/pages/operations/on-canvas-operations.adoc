== Double-Clicking the Canvas

*Double clicking the white area* on canvas will automatically generate a new node with

1. a transient ID prefixed with "transient-" followed by a random string. For example "transient-rxnnzr6t4x"

   [NOTE]
   ====

   The reason that the ID being transient is due to the fact that this ID won't be persisted into database. Refreshing
   the browser will replace this transient ID with a database-generated ID (in the form of a number, such as 65).

   Normally, neo4j-browser feeds into neo4j-arc, which is the graphing module of neo4j-browser, with a set of
   fully-hydrated set of nodes and relationships. This results in the design in neo4j-arc which is: to render a node or
   relationship, the ID of it must be provided (i.e. a required argument to node/rel constructor).

   Generating a new node by double-clicking, however, is an operation manged by neo4j-arc, which by design is not
   responsible for generating and managing node/relationship ID's. But to implement the "realtime editing" effect, the
   new node/rel ID has to be genreated at the beginning. 

   To resolve the conflict between original neo4j-browser design and on-canvas operation, any node/rel generated
   "on-canvas" will have this transient ID.

2. a label of "Undefined"
3. the node caption of "New Node"

== Editing the Node Label and Properties in Inspector Panel

[NOTE]
====
Make sure APOC plugin is enabled in Neo4J database:

*Clicking the property value* in node inspector panel will make that property editable and un-clicking the text box
(by for example clicking somewhere else) will persist the new value into Neo4J database:

Similary, we can modify node label:
