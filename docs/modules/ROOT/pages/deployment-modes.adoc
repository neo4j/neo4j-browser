[[bundled-neo4j]]
== Bundled with Neo4j

If you have installed the Neo4j database on you system, Neo4j Browser is bundled with Neo4j.
The default configuration is configured to start Neo4j Browser at port `7474` when you start Neo4j database.

The configuration https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.http_enabled_modules[dbms.http_enabled_modules] can be configured to not start Neo4j Browser by omitting `BROWSER` in the comma seperated list.

To access Neo4j Browser with the default configuration, start Neo4j by running the following command from your _<neo4j-home>_ directory:

[source, shell]
----
bin/neo4j start
----

Neo4j starts a web server with Neo4j Browser at `http://localhost:7474/browser`.


[[bundled-desktop]]
== Bundled with Neo4j Desktop

If you have installed Neo4j Desktop on your system, Neo4j Browser is bundled with Neo4j Desktop as a Neo4j Desktop application.

You can run Neo4j Browser via Neo4j Desktop as an application.
If you are using Neo4j Desktop, you can start the Neo4j Browser application from a project, provided that the Neo4j DBMS for that project is started.

. Download Neo4j desktop application.
. Install and start the Neo4j Desktop application using the provided instructions (shown when downloading).
Alternatively, after downloading the zipped server-only package, instructions can also be found in the readme (`bin/neo4j start`) after unzipping the downloaded file.
. Set up your first project and database following step 2 of the provided Neo4j Desktop instructions.
+
[NOTE]
====
Remember your password.
If you forget it, you have to remove the credentials file in _data/dbms/authorization_.
====
. Open the Neo4j Browser.

[[web-server]]
== Dedicated web server

It is possible to host a dedicated web server to serve Neo4j Browser as a web application.
The Neo4j Browser is a client side single page application (SPA), you can serve the static content with a HTTP server.

[NOTE]
====
If you have installed Neo4j on your system then disable the browser module (`BROWSER`) from running. +
See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.http_enabled_modules[dbms.http_enabled_modules] configuration.
====

=== HTTP web servers

Here is a list of suggestions for simple HTTP web servers that can be used to host the static content:

Python3 `http.server`::
Is a simple http server that is bundled with Python 3. Do not use in production environment. +
https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html
[source, shell]
----
python -m http.server --directory neo4j-browser/ 8080
----

Node.js `http-server`::
Is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server. +
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
[source, shell]
----
npx http-server -p 8080 neo4j-browser/
----

Node.js `serve`::
Is a simple http server that is ideal for serving a static site, single page application or just a static file. +
https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve
[source, shell]
----
npx serve -l 8080 neo4j-browser/
----

[TIP]
====
HTTP servers suitable for production use:

* Nginx -- is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy and a load balancer.
* Apache HTTP Server.
* Internet Information Services (IIS).

=== Get pre build and run web server

You can download Neo4j Browser from Maven (link:https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.neo4j.client/neo4j-browser[`https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.neo4j.client/neo4j-browser`]) and serve the web application with a HTTP server.


.Get pre build and run web server
====

**1. Download Neo4j Browser.**

Download Neo4j Browser from Maven:

[source, shell, subs="attributes+"]
----
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/neo4j/client/neo4j-browser/{neo4j-browser-version}/neo4j-browser-{neo4j-browser-version}.jar
----

Or manually go to link:https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.neo4j.client/neo4j-browser[`https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.neo4j.client/neo4j-browser`] and download Neo4j Browser.

**2. Unzip the .jar file.**

Unzip the `.jar` file:

[source, shell, subs="attributes+"]
----
unzip neo4j-browser-{neo4j-browser-version}.jar
----

**3. Host web application with a HTTP server.**

Start a web server (in this example you will start a web server with Python 3) to serve the content:

[source, shell]
----
python -m http.server --directory browser/ 8080
----

Point your web browser to `http://localhost:8080`.

**4. Test connecting to a Neo4j database instance.**

Start a Neo4j database instance to test for connection.
If you have the Neo4j tarball you can start the database instance with the command (assuming that the CWD is _<neo4j-home>_):

[source, shell]
----
bin/neo4j start
----

In Neo4j Browser connect to the Neo4j database instance with the URI:

[source, role=noheader]
----
neo4j://localhost:7687
----
====

See xref:operations#create-dbms-connection[Create a DBMS connection] for more details how to setup a connection to Neo4j in Neo4j Browser.


=== Build and run web server

You can build the source code and run Neo4j Browser.

The source code can be found at link:https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-browser[https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-browser].

.Build and run web server
====

**1. Get the source code.**

Clone the Neo4j Browser git repository.
The command will only get the `master` branch to save bandwidth and file space.

[source, shell]
----
git clone --single-branch --branch=master https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-browser/

[source, shell]
----
npm install
----

Build the project:

[source, shell]
----
npm build
----

**3. Host web application with a HTTP server.**

Start a web server (in this example you will start a web server with Python 3) to serve the content:

[source, shell]
----
python -m http.server --directory dist/ 8080
----

Point your web browser to `http://localhost:8080`.

See xref:operations#create-dbms-connection[Create a DBMS connection] for details how to setup a connection to Neo4j in Neo4j Browser.
