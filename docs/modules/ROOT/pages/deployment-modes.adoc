[[bundled-neo4j]]
== Neo4j Server

Neo4j is the world’s leading graph database.
The architecture is designed for optimal management, storage, and traversal of nodes and relationships.
There are two editions of Neo4j to choose from, the Community Edition and the Enterprise Edition.
The Enterprise Edition includes all that Community Edition has to offer, plus extra enterprise requirements such as backups, clustering, and failover capabilities.

Neo4j includes a web server that can host different HTTP modules.
If you are using the default configuration the web server will be started and host the `BROWSER` module (Neo4j Browser) at port `7474` when you start Neo4j.
The `BROWSER` module is avaialable in Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want to host Neo4j Browser when you start Neo4j, remove `BROWSER` from the comma-separated list of the configuration setting https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.http_enabled_modules[dbms.http_enabled_modules].
====

.Start Neo4j
====
Prerequisites for this example:

* Install the Neo4j linux tarball.
* Current working directory is _<neo4j-home>_.
* Using the default configuration.

Start Neo4j with the command:

[source, shell]
----
bin/neo4j start
----

Neo4j starts a web server with the `BROWSER` module (Neo4j Browser) on port `7474`. +
Point your web browser to link:http://localhost:7474/browser[_http://localhost:7474/browser_].
====


[[bundled-desktop]]
== Neo4j Desktop

Neo4j Desktop is a local development environment for working with Neo4j, whether using local database instances or databases located on remote servers.
It is designed to help you as a new user to learn and experiment with Neo4j locally by including everything you need to get started.

Neo4j Browser comes out-of-the-box when you install Neo4j Desktop on your system.
By default, Neo4j Browser is configured to start as a Neo4j Desktop application at port `7474`.
You start the Neo4j Browser application from a project in Neo4j Desktop, provided that the Neo4j DBMS for that project is started.

. Download Neo4j desktop application.
. Install and start the Neo4j Desktop application using the provided instructions (shown when downloading).
Alternatively, after downloading the zipped server-only package, instructions can also be found in the readme (`bin/neo4j start`) after unzipping the downloaded file.
. Set up your first project and database following step 2 of the provided Neo4j Desktop instructions.
+
[NOTE]
====
Remember your password.
If you forget it, you have to remove the credentials file in _data/dbms/authorization_.
====
. Open the Neo4j Browser.
+

+
Alternatively, you can access this from a regular browser window by typing _http://localhost:7474_ and signing in with *Username:* `neo4j` and *Password:* `<your database password (set up in Desktop)>`. +


[[web-application]]
== Web application

Neo4j Browser is available as a web application at link:https://browser.graphapp.io/[_https://browser.graphapp.io/_].
To setup up a connection to Neo4j with this web application (Neo4j Browser), you need a remote Neo4j instance that is configured with TLS.


[[sandbox]]
== Neo4j Sandbox

link:https://neo4j.com/sandbox/[Neo4j Sandbox] is a free, cloud-based instance of Neo4j, where you can learn about Neo4j, test your ideas, or play around with the pre-built data examples.

When you launch a project, it opens Neo4j Browser as a web application.
The Neo4j Browser web application connects to your Neo4j instance that the sandbox created for you, without having to enter any connection URI.

[[aura]]
== Neo4j Aura

link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/[Neo4j Aura] is Neo4j’s fully managed cloud service.
Neo4j Aura is a fast, reliable, scalable and completely automated graph database as a cloud service.

Neo4j Browser can be accessed as a web application within the user interface of link:https://console.neo4j.io/[Neo4j Aura console].
The Neo4j Browser web application connects to your Neo4j instance without having to enter any connection URI.

[[web-server]]
== Dedicated web server

The Neo4j Browser is a client-side single-page application (SPA), which uses an HTTP server for its static content.
It is possible to host a dedicated web server to serve Neo4j Browser as a web application.
Download Neo4j Browser from link:https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.neo4j.client/neo4j-browser[Maven].

Here are some use cases of why this deployment mode could be useful.

Neo4j Browser local hosted::
This case is valid if you have access to a Neo4j instance and do not want to install Neo4j Desktop or do not want to use a hosted Neo4j Browser web application.
It is a simple solution, start a local hosted Neo4j Browser web application on your machine with a simple one-line command.
It is also easy to run a specific version of Neo4j Browser, download the preferred version from link:https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.neo4j.client/neo4j-browser[Maven].

Neo4j Browser deployed web application::
If you want to have specific network configurations within your network and host Neo4j Browser for quick access within your organization, you can host Neo4j Browser with an HTTP web server.
This allows for full control of configuring the HTTP web server as needed.
For example you way want to add a layer of access control to access the Neo4j Browser web application and configure the HTTP web server connection to use TLS.

Extend or improve the source code::
Neo4j Browser is open source (GNU General Public License v3.0), and the source code can be found at link:https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-browser[_https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-browser_].
If you want to extend or contribute to the project, you can alter the code.
This allows you to run a modified version of Neo4j Browser.


[TIP]
====
If you have installed Neo4j on your system, then disable the browser module (`BROWSER`) from running. +
For more information, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.http_enabled_modules[dbms.http_enabled_modules] configuration setting.
