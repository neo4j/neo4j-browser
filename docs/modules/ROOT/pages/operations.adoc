By default, Neo4j Browser communicates with a Neo4j DBMS via the link:https://7687.org/[Bolt Protocol] using the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/javascript-manual/current/[Neo4j JavaScript Driver] to execute Cypher queries.
However, it is possible to turn off Bolt and use HTTP(S), instead as in older versions of Neo4j Browser.
//The HTTP API can be used with the REST request commands (`:head`, `:get`, `:post`, `:put`, and `:delete`).


[[uri-schema]]
=== Connection URI schemas

Neo4j Browser supports the following connection URI schemas:

* `neo4j://`(unencrypted) and `neo4j+s://` (encrypted with TLS) -- work on either a single instance or a cluster.
Routing is handled by the driver.
If used on a cluster, it routes to a cluster member, not necessarily the system at the IP that you specified.
Queries executed over that protocol route according to the transaction functions --_write_ transactions go to the leader and _read_ transactions route between followers and read replicas.

* `bolt://`(unencrypted) and `bolt+s://` (encrypted with TLS) -- connect only to the server with the IP you specify.
It does not route anywhere else.
All queries over this protocol go only to this machine, whether they are _read_ or _write_ queries.
_Write_ queries error out if not being sent to the Cluster leader.

If used on a single server (not a cluster), then queries over them will behave identically.
A difference in the behavior in `neo4j://` and `bolt://` is seen only if addressing a cluster member.

[TIP]

[[manage-connection]]
=== Manage connection commands

The `:server` command lets you manage the connection to Neo4j, such as connecting, disconnecting, and viewing metadata for the current connection.

Usage::	`:server <action>`

Actions::
* `:server status` -- Connection status.
This is your current connection information.
* `:server change-password` -- Opens the frame *Password change*, where you can change your current password.

Auth::
* `:server connect` -- Opens the frame *Connect to Neo4j*.
If connected to the server, the frame shows the current user and the connection URL.
Otherwise, enter the name of the database you want to connect, the DBMS URL, and the user credentials.
* `:server disconnect` -- Opens the frame *Disconnected*, which shows that the current user is disconnected from the server.
Then, it runs the `:server connect` automatically.

User::
`:help server user` - opens the frame *User admin*.

Neo4j Browser is available as a web application at _https://browser.graphapp.io/_.

.Neo4j Browser - Sandbox

In link:https://neo4j.com/sandbox/[Neo4j sandbox], you can launch a Neo4j Browser web application by clicking *Open with Browser*.
It automatically connects with a connection URL similar to:

`bolt+s://ba99a8c2d1c755f0c0cc2a95d0a627ea.neo4jsandbox.com:7687`

.Neo4j Browser - Neo4j Aura

In the https://console.neo4j.io[Neo4j Aura console], Neo4j Browser can be accessed as a web application within the user interface.
The Neo4j Browser web application connects to your Neo4j instance without having to enter any connection URL.

The connection URL is similar to:

`neo4j+s://358a0e8a.databases.neo4j.io`

Each database has a `dbid` that can be inferred from the Aura Console.

The URL _\https://<dbid>.databases.neo4j.io/browser/_ can also be used to access Neo4j Browser for that specific `dbid` on Neo4j Aura.

[[security-browser]]
== Browser credentials handling

Neo4j Browser has two mechanisms for avoiding users having to enter their Neo4j credentials repeatedly.

First, while the Browser is open in a web browser tab, it ensures that the existing database session is kept alive.
This is subject to a timeout.
The timeout is configured in the setting link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_browser.credential_timeout[`browser.credential_timeout`].
The timeout is reset whenever there is user interaction with the Browser.

Second, the Browser can also cache the user's Neo4j credentials locally.
When credentials are cached, they are stored unencrypted in the web browser's local storage.
If the web browser tab is closed and then re-opened, the session is automatically re-established using the cached credentials.
This local storage is also subject to the timeout configured in the setting `browser.credential_timeout`.
In addition, caching credentials in browser local storage can be disabled altogether.
To disable credentials caching, set link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_browser.retain_connection_credentials[`browser.retain_connection_credentials=false`] in the server configuration.

If the user issues a `:server disconnect` command, any existing session is terminated, and the credentials are cleared from the local storage.


[[adjust-settings]]
== Adjust Browser settings

The Neo4j Browser defaults for all settings can be adjusted at any time in Neo4j Browser and globally.

To view all currently configured settings, run `:config`.

[[adjust-in-browser]]
=== Adjust settings in Browser

To change the configuration settings locally in Neo4j Browser, you can either use the tabs in the Browser Settings drawer or, in the Cypher editor, type the command `:config` together with the setting and the new value.


.Adjust an individual setting
====
The example shows how to change the maximum number of neighbors for a node.
[source, cypher]
----
:config maxNeighbours:100
----
====


.Adjust several settings
====
The example shows how to change the `maxFrames` from its default of `50` to `10` and the theme to `outline`.
[source, cypher]
----
:config {maxFrames: 10, theme: "outline"}
----
After making the change, re-running `:config` reports that `maxFrames` has been set to `10`, and the theme is defined to `outline`.
The *Browser Settings* drawer also reflects this change.
====


[WARNING]
====
Adjusting the settings first resets the configuration to the default configuration and then sets the given configurations.
====


[[adjust-globally]]
=== Adjust settings globally

To change the configuration settings for all users of Neo4j Browser, modify the _neo4j.conf_ file, or if using link:[Neo4j Desktop], navigate to the DBMS which settings you want to update, click the ellipsis dropdown menu, and select *Settings*.

For example, to change the `maxFrames` from its default of `50` to `10` and the theme to `outline`, add the following line to _neo4j.conf_:


[source, properties]
----
browser.post_connect_cmd=config {maxFrames:10, theme: "outline"}
----

This changes the `maxFrames` from its default of `50` to `10` and then restarts Neo4j.


.Global Browser settings
[options="header" cols=",,"]
|===
| Browser Setting

| Configure the Neo4j Browser to store or not store user credentials.
|===


[[start-browser]]
== Start with Browser

When you first open Neo4j Browser and connect to a Neo4j DBMS, it automatically executes the command `:play start`. +
The `:play start` command outputs an entry page containing interactive guides that you can use to learn some Neo4j concepts, try Neo4j with live data (MovieGraph), and write some basic Cypher queries.
Besides, you can also navigate to the *Help & Learn* drawer in the sidebar, where you will find more information about useful commands, a lot of built-in guides, and links to documentation.

If you want to change the initially executed command, navigate to the *Browser Settings* drawer in the sidebar and add a new value for the *Initial command to execute* setting.

[TIP]
====
For more information on how to enter and run Cypher queries and commands, see xref:visual-tour.adoc#editor[Cypher editor]. +
For more information about Cypher, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/{neo4j-version}/[Cypher Manual] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/{neo4j-version}/[Neo4j Cypher Refcard].
====

[[results]]
== Visualize results

There are a variety of ways to view data in Neo4j Browser.
All queries that you run in the Cypher editor populate a reusable result frame.
Query results are rendered as:

* Visual graph
* Table
* Plain text table
* JSON

You can switch between those with the icons on the left side of the result frame.


[TIP]
====
If you cannot see the result, you might be in Graph mode but had your query return tabular/scalar data.
To see the results, switch the mode to the *Table* view.
====


[[graph-view]]
=== Graph

The graph visualization functionality is designed to display a node-graph representation of the underlying data stored in the database in response to a given Cypher query.
It shows circles for nodes and lines for relationships, and is especially useful for determining areas of interest or quickly assessing the current state and organization of the data.

image:graph.png[]


.Handy tips
[TIP]
====
* Enable zoom in and out of your graph by entering into fullscreen mode.
* Expand and remove nodes from the visualization by clicking a node.
It gets a halo, where you can dismiss a node, expand/collapse child relationships, or unlock the node to re-layout the graph.
Double-clicking a node expands its child relationships.
* If you cannot see the whole graph or the results display too close together, you can adjust by moving the visual view and dragging nodes to rearrange them.
* To move the view to see more parts of the graph, click an empty spot within the graph pane and drag it.
* To rearrange nodes, click and drag them around.
* The nodes already have sensible captions assigned by the browser, which auto-selects a property from the property list to use as a caption.
You can see all the properties of that element if you click any node or relationship.
Properties appear below the visualization.
* Larger property sets might be collapsed into a subset, and there is a little triangle on the right to unfold them.
For example, if you click one of the `Movie` nodes in the MovieGraph (`:play movie graph`), you can see its properties below the graph visualization.
The same applies to `Actor` nodes and the `ACTED_IN` relationships.
====


[[table-view]]
=== Table

The *Table* result view displays the result in a table format.
It also reports the query time, including the actual query execution time, latency, and deserialization costs.

image:table.png[]

Even if you feel that the relationship is not hard to find in the tabular format, imagine if you have a graph containing the entire filmography careers of these persons and hundreds of other actors, directors, and film crew members.
The connections could easily be lost in a non-visual presentation.

[[text-view]]
=== Text

The *Text* result view displays the result as a plain text table.
It also reports the query time, including the actual query execution time, latency, and deserialization costs.

image:text.png[]


[[code-view]]
=== Code

The *Code* result view displays the submitted request, the Neo4j Server version and address, and the response.
It also reports the query time, including the actual query execution time, latency, and deserialization costs.

image:code.png[]


[[export-results]]
== Export results

You can download your query results using the down-pointed arrow on the right side of the result frame.
The following download options available:


.Download the result from the *Graph* view
[#download_graph]
[caption="Export as an image"]
image:download-graph.png[Export graph, width=50%]


.Download the result from the *Table*, *Text*, and *Code* views
[#download_csv]
[caption="Export as a CSV file"]
image:download-csv-json.png[Export table, width=50%]


[NOTE]
====
The *Save as project file* is available only in Neo4j Desktop.
For more information, see xref:visual-tour.adoc#saved-files[Project files].
====


[[styling]]
== Style Neo4j Browser Visualization

You can customize your graph query result either in place or by using Graph Stylesheet (GraSS).


[[graph-style]]
=== Style your graph visualization in place

Neo4j Browser also provides functionality for styling with color and size, based on node labels and relationship types.

If you click any label or relationship above the graph visualization, you can choose its styling in the area below the graph.
Colors, sizes, and captions are selectable from there.
To see this for yourself, you can click the `Person` label above the graph and change the color, size, and captions of all nodes labeled with `Person`.
The same applies to the relationship `ACTED_IN`.


.Changes to nodes labeled `Person`
[#style_person_node]
[caption="Changes to nodes labeled `Person`"]
image:style_person_node.png[]


.Changes to relationships labeled `ACTED_IN`
[#style_actedin_relationship]
[caption="Changes to relationships labeled `ACTED_IN`"]
image:style_actedin_relationship.png[]


[[grass]]
=== Style your graph visualization using a GraSS file

Alternatively, follow the steps to customize your styles by importing a graph stylesheet (GraSS) file for Neo4j Browser to reference.

. Run the command `:style` and download your current graph style by using the *Export GraSS* option.
+
[NOTE]
====
Neo4j supports both CSS and JSON format as a _.grass_ file contents.

[[query-parameters]]
== Neo4j query parameters

//https://dzone.com/articles/neo4jcypher-getting-hang-query - a blog post by Mark Needham

Neo4j Browser supports querying based on parameters.
It allows the Cypher query planner to re-use your queries instead of parse and build new execution plans.

Parameters can be used for:

* literals and expressions
* node and relationship IDs

Parameters cannot be used for the following constructs, as these form part of the query structure that is compiled into a query plan:

* property keys
* relationship types
* labels

Parameters may consist of letters and numbers and any combination of these but cannot start with a number or a currency symbol.


[TIP]
====
For more details on the Cypher parameters, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/{neo4j-version}/syntax/parameters/[Cypher Manual v.{neo4j-version} - Parameters].
====


[[set-params]]
=== Set query parameters

You can set a parameter to be sent with your queries by using the `:param` command.
Using parameters rather than hard-coded values allows for the reuse of the query plan cache.

The `+:param name => 'Example'+` command defines a parameter named `name`, which will be sent along with your queries. +
The right hand side of `=>` is sent to the server and evaluated as Cypher with an implicit `RETURN` in front.
This gives better type safety since some types (especially numbers) in JavaScript are hard to match with Neo4j:s type system.
To see the list of all currently set query parameters and their values, use the `:params` command.
For more information on how to use the commands, see `:help param` and `:help params`.


[NOTE]
====
If you are using a multi-database DBMS, parameters cannot be declared when using the `system` database.
Switch to a different database and declare, then switch back to the `system` database and use them.

=== Duration for the query parameters

Parameters are not saved when you close the browser.
You can save a `:params` command as a favorite to quickly populate parameters again.

//Depending on how the favorite have been saved you can.
//Save the favorites to persist in the cloud with Browser Sync.
//Save the favorites to persist on the disk if you are using Neo4j Desktop.
//Save the favorites to persist in the browsers local storage.
//The localStorage and sessionStorage properties allow to save key/value pairs in a web browser.


[[url-parameters]]
== Browser URL parameters

Neo4j Browser supports some URL parameters defined in the query component.
The query component is preceded by a question mark (`?`) and contains a query string that is a sequence of key–value pairs separated by an ampersand (`&`).

// == Executing REST requests
// You can also execute REST requests with Neo4j Browser.
// The command syntax is :COMMAND /a/path {"some":"data"}. The available commands are :GET, :POST, :PUT and :DELETE.
//
// A simple query like :GET /db/data/ inspects the available endpoints of the database, with the returned results formatted in JSON.
// Then, you can retrieve all labels in the database with :GET /db/data/labels.
//
// To execute a Cypher statement, you post to the transaction Cypher endpoint like this:
//
// JavaScript
// Copy to Clipboard
// :POST /db/data/transaction/commit {"statements":[
//      {"statement":"MATCH (m:Movie)  WHERE m.title={title} RETURN m.title, m.released, labels(m)",
//       "parameters":{"title":"Cloud Atlas"}}]}
// There are endless possibilities to send and retrieve data using REST.
// In a later guide, you can create an application to interact with Neo4j and use REST endpoints for interaction between you and the database.
// See the Language Guides section for more information.
