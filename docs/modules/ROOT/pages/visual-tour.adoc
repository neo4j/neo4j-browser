:description: This chapter presents a visual overview of the UI of Neo4j Browser.

This section walks you through the UI of Neo4j Browser.

[[overview]]
== Overview

image:overview.png[]

[[sidebar]]
== Sidebar

The sidebar contains a set of drawers to set up the environment for graph management and explore your data.

[[database-info]]
=== Database Information

The Database Information drawer provides information about the currently used database, the current user's roles, the Neo4j DBMS version, and some helpful DBMS administrative commands.

image:database-information.png[height=40%]

* *Use database* -- A dropdown menu, where you can select the database you want to work with.
* *Node Labels*, *Relationship Types*, and *Property keys* -- Clicking any one of those options runs a quick query to show you a sample of the graph with those elements.
* *Connected as* -- Shows the current user and their roles and the Cypher command to disconnect from the server.
If the current user has an administrative role, two more options are available: `:server user add` and `:server user list`.
For more information about user's built-in roles and the default privileges, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/authentication-authorization/built-in-roles/[Operations Manual -> Built-in roles].
* *DBMS* -- Provides information about the Neo4j version and edition, and some helpful DBMS administrative commands:
** `:dbs` -- List all databases available for the current user.
** `:sysinfo` -- Display data about the Neo4j system, such as store size, ID allocation, page cache, transactions, and databases (name, address, role, status, default database, and errors).
** `:queries` -- List all currently running queries on the server.

[[favorites]]
=== Favorites

The *Favorites* drawer is where you keep your bookmarked queries and commands.

image:favorites.png[]

==== Save a query as a favorite

You can save Cypher queries and commands as favorites by "starring" them.
Use the *Add empty favorite* option to open an empty script in the Cypher editor, then write the query that you want to bookmark.
Clicking the *Save as Favorite* icon to the right of the editor adds the query to your *Favorites* list in the left-side menu.
All favorites are stored in your local browser storage and are centric to the user/browser who has recorded those favorites.
Clearing your Browser cache removes all your local favorites.

[NOTE]
====
You can save your favorites, settings, and styles in the cloud with Neo4j Browser Sync.
====

==== Run a favorite

To run one of your favorites, click the left-side menu *Favorites*, choose the query, and run it.

==== Add a title to a favorite

The first line of the Cypher query or command will be used to name your favorite.
To provide a title or helpful info to your favorite, you can use a comment `//comment` above your query.
The *Favorites* menu uses this comment to name the saved query.

.Favorite: Hello Cypher
====
[source, cypher]
----
//Hello Cypher
MATCH (n)
RETURN n
LIMIT 100
----
====

==== Organize your favorites

Creating folders can help organize your favorites.
You can rearrange them by dragging and delete them if they are no longer useful.

==== Sample Scripts

There are several built-in favorites, which can help you manage and explore your data.

* *Basic Queries* contains simple queries to get you started with Neo4j.
For example, clicking and running the *Get Some Data* query executes the statement `MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 100`, which fetches some nodes.
* *Example Graphs* contains queries that run the built-in guides The Movie Graph and The Northwind Database.
For more information on the Neo4j Browser built-in guides, see <<guides>>.
* *Data Profiling* contains queries that you can use to collect statistics and produce informative summaries about the underlying data.
For example, clicking and running the *What is related, and how* query executes the procedure `CALL db.schema.visualization()`, which shows the graph data model (graph schema).
* *Common Procedures* contains a few Neo4j procedures, two of which list all available Neo4j functions and procedures.

[[saved-files]]
=== Project Files

[NOTE]
====
The *Project files* tab is **Neo4j Desktop** specific.
====

Project files allow you to save queries, guides, and other scripts, as Cypher files.
Unlike favorites, which are saved in your local browser storage, project files are project-specific and are actual files stored in the project directory on your hard drive.
All save files are listed under the project they refer to.
For more information, see link:[Neo4j Desktop Manual -> ???].

[[help-learn]]
=== Help & Learn

The *Help & Learn* drawer contains useful commands, built-in guides, links to documentation, notifications, and a send feedback button.

image:help.png[]

[[useful-commands]]
==== Useful commands

[[adjust-in-browser]]
==== Adjust settings in Browser

To change the configuration settings locally in Neo4j Browser, you can either use the tabs in the Browser Settings drawer or, in the Cypher editor, type the command `:config` together with the setting and the new value.

.Adjust an individual setting
====
The example shows how to change the maximum number of neighbors for a node.
[source, cypher]
----
:config maxNeighbours:100
----
====

.Adjust several settings
====
The example shows how to change the `maxFrames` from its default of `50` to `10` and the theme to `outline`.
[source, cypher]
----
:config {maxFrames: 10, theme: "outline"}
----
After making the change, re-running `:config` reports that `maxFrames` has been set to `10`, and the theme is defined to `outline`.
The *Browser Settings* drawer also reflects this change.
====

[WARNING]
====
Adjusting the settings first resets the configuration to the default configuration and then sets the given configurations.
====

[[adjust-globally]]
==== Adjust settings globally

To change the configuration settings for all users of Neo4j Browser, modify the _neo4j.conf_ file, or if using link:[Neo4j Desktop], navigate to the DBMS which settings you want to update, click the ellipsis dropdown menu, and select *Settings*.

For example, to change the `maxFrames` from its default of `50` to `10` and the theme to `outline`, add the following line to _neo4j.conf_:

[source, properties]
----
browser.post_connect_cmd=config {maxFrames:10, theme: "outline"}
----

This changes the `maxFrames` from its default of `50` to `10` and then restarts Neo4j.

[[editor]]
== Cypher editor

The Cypher editor is the primary interface for entering and running Cypher queries and commands.

image:screen_editor.png[]

[NOTE]
====
From Neo4j Browser 4.2.4, the Cypher editor is based on link:https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/[Monaco Editor], the code editor that powers link:https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode[Visual Studio Code (VS Code)].
Even though it is the same text editor as VS Code, it is not the entire VS Code package.
For example, plugins are not included and are not possible to implement.
====

Some of the Cypher editor features include:

* Cypher queries to work with graph data.
* The editor can be instantiated several times, which allows you to edit the query inside the result frame and re-run it.
* Single-line editing for brief queries or commands.
* Multi-line editing for long queries or commands.
* REST request commands (`:GET`, `:POST`, `:PUT`, and `:DELETE`).
* Syntax highlighting:
** A smart highlight of matching pairs around the current position of the cursor, for example, matching brackets, braces, and parenthesis.
** Matching pairs are auto-closed.
** A smart highlight of identical words on a word click.
** Words, such as attributes, anon name, and values, are highlighted in different colors.
** Any punctuation, such as parenthesis and comma, has a slightly different color than text.
* Quick comment/uncomment.
* Indentation and folding. +
You can fold an indented code snippet.
This way, you can hide lots of code.
* Search and replace. +
For example, you can search for a particular label (e.g., `: Actor`) and replace all its occurrences (with `: Person`).
* Autocomplete for browser commands can autocomplete several words.
* Warnings are displayed with a squiggly line that you hover, and you get a pop-up.
* Client-side commands like `:help` for other operations.
* Command palette (F1) with all of the available commands with their shortcuts.
The currently available commands can be turned on and off.

[[reusable-frames]]
== Reusable result frames

Neo4j Browser reusable result frames allow you to edit the query of an existing result directly in the result frame and re-run to update the result in situ. +
Each reusable frame maintains its own local history of commands and updates the main one in the Cypher editor, should you need to instantiate a new result frame from there.

image:inline-result-editor.gif[]

[[frame-views]]
=== Result frame views

Neo4j Browser supports different result frame views to suit your needs:

* Graph -- Display the result as nodes and relationships and allow xref:operations.adoc#styling[styling] to be configured.
* Table -- Display the result as JSON formatted rows.
* Text -- Display the result as a plain text table.
* Code -- Display the submitted request, the Neo4j Server version and address, and the response.

For more details on the different ways of viewing data in Neo4j Browser, see xref:operations.adoc#results[Visualizing results].

[[stream]]
=== Stream

A stream is a scrolling series of result frames.

image:screen_stream.png[]

A reusable result frame is created for each command execution, added to the top of the stream to create a scrollable collection in reverse chronological order.

Remove all the frames from the stream with the `:clear` command.
