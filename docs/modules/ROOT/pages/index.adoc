Neo4j Browser is a developer-focused tool that allows you to execute Cypher queries and visualize the results.
It is the default developer interface for both Enterprise and Community editions of Neo4j.
It comes out-of-the-box with all of Neo4jâ€™s graph database offerings, including Neo4j Server (Community and Enterprise editions), Neo4j AuraDB (Neo4j's Database as a Service), and Neo4j Desktop (all OS versions).
